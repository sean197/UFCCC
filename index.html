            <h2>Ultimate Fighting Championship</h2>
            <p>
                The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is an American mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion company
                 based in Las Vegas, Nevada, 
                which is owned and operated by Endeavor Group Holdings along with Silver Lake Partners,
                 Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and MSD Capital via Zuffa, LLC.
                  It is the largest MMA promotion company in the world and features some of the highest-level
                   fighters in the sport on its roster. The UFC produces events worldwide that showcase twelve weight
                    divisions (eight men's divisions and four women's divisions) and abides by the Unified Rules of 
                    Mixed Martial Arts.[6] As of 2020, the UFC has held over 500 events. Dana White has been
                     UFC president since 2001. Under White's stewardship, 
                the UFC has grown into a globally popular multi-billion-dollar enterprise.

                    The first event was held in 1993 at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado.
                     The purpose of the early Ultimate Fighting Championship competitions was to identify the most
                      effective martial art in a contest with minimal rules and no weight classes between competitors of
                       different fighting disciplines like Boxing, Kickboxing, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, Wrestling,
                        Muay Thai, Karate, Taekwondo, and Judo. In subsequent events, fighters began adopting effective 
                        techniques from more than one discipline, which indirectly helped create a separate style of
                         fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts. In 2016, UFC's parent company, Zuffa, was
                          sold to a group led by William Morris Endeavor (WMEâ€“IMG),
                     including Silver Lake Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and MSD Capital for US$4.025 billion

                        Newly crowned UFC flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo made his first title defence in impressive fashion in the main event of UFC 255.
                    </bold>
                    <p>
                        The 32-year-old, who captured the vacant title with victory over long-time contender Joseph Benavidez in July, needed fewer than two minutes to submit American Alex Perez in the headline bout at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.

                            Figueiredo and Perez both started quickly as the pair traded powerful strikes early on before the American attempted to take the fight to the canvas.

                            The challenger successfully landed a takedown on the champion but, as the pair scrambled for position on the mat, Figueiredo locked up a tight guillotine choke off his back and forced the Dana White's Contender Series graduate to tap after just 1:57 of the opening round.

                            The Brazilian's victory extended his winning run to five, with his past four victories all coming inside the distance, as he cemented his status at the top of the men's 125lb division.

                        Former two-weight UFC champion Conor McGregor will return to the octagon in January for a second fight with Dustin Poirier.
                    </bold>
                    <p>
                                     Irishman McGregor, 32, retired in June for the third time in four years.

                                    UFC president Dana White said "it was never a concern" that McGregor would not sign a deal to fight on 23 January at UFC 257.

                                    "If Conor McGregor says he wants to fight, Conor McGregor shows up," White told Barstool Sports.

                                    White also said he hopes fans will be able to attend.

                                    The UFC has hosted events without fans since the Covid-19 outbreak at White's private Fight Island, but he is hoping for an "international crowd" for McGregor's return.

                                    "All the things people have seen all over the world with Fight Island, now you will get the opportunity to come there and be a part of it," White said. "That's what I'm shooting for."

                        The Brazilian, 45, announced in October that his fight in Las Vegas on Saturday, which ended in defeat by Uriah Hall, would be his last.

                            Silva, whose first professional fight came in 1997, joined the UFC in 2006 and held the middleweight title for a record seven years.

                            "I've enjoyed my moment," Silva said.

                            "Sometimes it's very difficult for us to stop. Today is the final day and I'm so happy to be here doing my last show for my fans and my UFC family," he told UFC commentator Michael Bisping, Britain's first UFC champion.

                            On whether it would be his final appearance in the octagon, he said: "I don't know. First I'll go back home and see with my team everything. Let's see. It's tough to say it's my last or not because this is what I [have done] for my entire life."
